## Numbers
Numbers are one of the data types in programming. There are whole numbers and float point numbers.
If we decided to use a float in a computation we need to convert either of the operands to a decimal 
```ruby
puts 5 / 2 # => 2
puts 5 / 2.0 # => 2.5
```

## Booleans
Like two faces of a coin booleans represent true and false values

## Strings
Sequences of chars makes a string. This data type comes with many pre made methods

## Variables
If we need to store an execution or a value we need a variable. Variables are useful pieces of information and can be any type of data.

## Methods
Methods are useful tools especially you need to make your code more readable.
For example you have a sum operation which you need to perform on a 2D array you need to define it wonce and fre to use it any where you whch to use. This is also true for portability and `DRY` (don't repeat yourself) is been realize with methods (functions).

## Conditionals
Conditinals are useful if you dont have a single work flow. You can make decision and manage the output with conditinal structures

## Loops 
Loops together with  conditionals they form the primitive work flow. This way we can tell computer what to do and how many times to repeat it. 

## Arrays
After many data type we can learn about arrays this data type is not necesserily for single data. You can combine lists and series of events This is all convenied for the array data types.

## Hashes
Hashs are like dictionaries. While arrays are great for the lists. We can decribe an individual item without losing details. And therefore we use hashes. Hashes are like arrays they have keys as identifiers like array they are useful for finding the value for the key.

## Conclusion
While we explore the possibilities of programming with the basic blocks we learn that many simple construct can be created as hight order functions and our program can became less complex and easy to read by the interested parties. This is especially true for loops and  steps for the creating and entering arrays based on special criteria. So there we have it. Thanks for the reading
