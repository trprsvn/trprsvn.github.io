## Data Types
### Numbers
Numbers are one of the data types in programming
We have floating points and if we do math on them if either of them is float we 
will get float 
for example
```ruby
puts 9 / 2.0
# outputs 4.5
puts 9 / 2 
# outputs 4
```
### Booleans
Booleans can be either `false` or `true` and we have following operators which 
work on booleans
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `==` equal
- `!=` not equal
- `&&` and
- `||` or


> __Warning:__ `&&` and `||` have lower priority than the other operator so watchout or use explicit parenthesis.

### Strings
Strings are sequence of characters and can be outputed with `print` and `p`
the difference is in the ruby ther are escaping characters like tabs `\t`, `\n`
